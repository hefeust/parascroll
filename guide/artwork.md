Srpties are drawn in Blender 3D and background is cutted with Krita. These ere nice and amazing free softwares ! I also used Imagick convert via command line to concatenate spritesheets.

Due to my vision problems and lack of time, I make the sprites in the quick-and-dirty way.

Fairly I suggest to :

- use a wide angle camera (18mm or 12mm focal length) to make possible the fact of having little houses in some sprites and big buildings in others.

* make as squared as possible sprites, but it's not an absolute need

* adjust FPS from 10 to 20, and velocity less than 15 to 30 pixels per layer.
